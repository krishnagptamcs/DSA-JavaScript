 Defenation:

 A graph is a non-linear ds that consisit of a finit number of a vertices (aslo called as node) connected by edges

 tree are specific type a graph data structure 

 Types:
 Vertices: set of circle , A,B,C 
 Edges: the line connecting A-B-C

 Directed Graps:- a graph in which edges have direction

 Undirected Graph- a graph in which edges do not have any direction

Uses
Google maps
Cites are represetend as vertices  ,
Roads are represetend as a edges to help build a navigation system

Social Media sites
User are represetend as a vertices and links b/w connection are edges 
fb, insta , linked in, all show mutual connection ,post suggestion, and other recomendation


Representation

Adjency Matrix: 
An adjency matric is a 2d array of size VxV where V is the number of vertices in the graph
Each row and coloum represent a vertex 
if any valye of any element say , matrix[i][j] is 1, it represent that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j
Adjency List



//The graph represent as 2d array in the javascript .

//Adjecny matrix of a graph
const matrix = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0],
];

console.log(matrix[0][1]); // the 0 postion matrix , and inside this the 1st postion element

//Adjency List of a graph
//vertices are stored in a map like data structure and every vertex stores a list of its adjecent vertices

adjacencyList = {
  A: ["B"],
  B: ["A", "C"],
  C: ["B"],
};

console.log(adjacencyList["C"]); //--> B

//A--->B
//B--->A,C
//C--->B
